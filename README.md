## The Process

The process I went through creating the project.

### My workflow

I built this project with the help of the video created by **Kevin Powell**. I have made some _slight_ changes in the code. But not much. I found a lot of HTML and CSS stuff that I had never ever heard of. I had fun going through his video and exploring things.

### Built With

- Languages
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
- Technologies
  - CSS Flexbox
  - CSS Custom properties
  - CSS Grid layout
  - Responsive design

### What I learned

- CSS
  - the use of `:is()` pseudo class in CSS
  - Use of `display: flex;` in various ways
- HTML
  - `<source srcset="">` from HTML
  - Learned to add better classnames to HTML elements.
